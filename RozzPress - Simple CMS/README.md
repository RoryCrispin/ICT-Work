RozzPress - Simple CMS
======================
Sddignment spec: 
From: http://www.edexcel.com/migrationdocuments/BTEC%20Nationals%20from%202010/Unit-27-Web-Server-Scripting.pdf
"Implement, test and document a web content management system to meet a defined need" 
"Implement an error log for a website using web server scripting."
"Create a web application to generate website statistics using web server scripting"

As it happens, from this unit I only acturally needed to install a web CMS like WordPress but I had some extra time
and I wanted an interesting coding project for the night so I sat down and write my own in one evening.

My spec: 'I need to develop a simple blogging platform for offices to post news articles to other members of the office. Everyone will have access to create new posts and theyâ€™ll need to be able to distinguish between different authors. Members will also need to change the name, bio and about section of the Blog. The site should be accessible from a mobile browser so clients can update the blog on the go. '
