PaintSim2000 - Basic Programming
================================
This was a very simple application developed for an introductory programming unit in the course. 


I've written it in both python as a command line interface and Obj-C as an app because after writing it in Python my tutor told me I'd cut too many corners by not using unnecessary temp variables and combining calculations together ect and I wouldn't be able to get the marks for 'justification of data types' and such because I'd barely used any. As such I had to re-write the application in a more complex way so I acturally had something to plan.  


Spec: 
1.	Design a program to be used by an interior decorator to estimate the cost of painting a room.  The decorator needs to enter the height of the room (between 2 and 6 metres), then the length of all four walls (minimum 1 metre; maximum 25 metres).  The program should then calculate the total area of the room.
The program should allow a choice of three paints:
•	Luxury quality which cost £1.75 per square metre
•	Standard quality which costs £1.00 per square metre.
•	Economy quality which costs £0.45 per square meter.
The decorator should also be able to choose to use undercoat paint if required, which costs an additional £0.50 per square metre.
The program should display an itemised bill with a total 
Evidence will be in the form of notes describing how the program will function. (P6)
